This is a basic console-based file manager written in Python.
It allows the user to create, read, delete, and list files in the current directory.

What this project practices

	•	Working with files (open, read, write)
	•	Using loops (while)
	•	Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
	•	Using the os module
	•	Handling user input
	•	Building a simple menu-driven program

Available actions

	•	Create a file and write content to it
	•	Read and display a file’s content
	•	Delete a file
	•	List all files in the current directory
	•	Exit the program

Future improvements

	•	Add an Append option to add text to an existing file
	•	Show file size when listing files
	•	Ask for confirmation before deleting a file
	•	Handle errors with try / except instead of only if checks
	•	Add folder support (create, delete, list folders)
	•	Allow navigation between directories (cd-like behavior)
	•	Filter files by extension (e.g. show only .txt files)
	•	Add timestamps (created / modified date)
    •	Add search functionality for files by name
	•	Log all actions to a file (create, delete, read)
	•	Add user roles (read-only vs admin)
	•	Add a simple GUI using tkinter
	•	Add password protection
